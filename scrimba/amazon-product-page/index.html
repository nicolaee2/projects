                    Long gone are the good old days when a catâ€™s biggest worries
                    were mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront
                    satanists, online predators, the possibility of needing to
                    survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and countless other
                    threats to their nine lives.

                    For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots
                    have stood at the vanguard of our country's defense by
                    helping to prepare our nation's cat owners for the difficult
                    conversations they dread having with their pets.

                    Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat
                    About Gun Safety answers crucial questions such as, "What is
                    the right age to talk to my cat about the proper use of
                    firearms?" and "What are the benefits of my cat living a
                    lifestyle of abstinence?" and especially "Why does my cat
                    need to use the internet? Can't he just play with yarn like
                    cats used to do?"
